If you think machine learning will revolutionize healthcare, come work with us! Students, postdocs, residents/fellows with clinical and/or computational backgrounds are encouraged to apply to work with us. Inquiries should be emailed directly to Dr. Arnaout and should include a CV and a letter of interest clearly but briefly articulating why you are potentially interested in joining the lab. Candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.
