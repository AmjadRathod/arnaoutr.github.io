<h1 id="join-us"> We Are Hiring! </h1>
<hr>

We are hiring a data scientist with early-to-mid career skills and experience. The position offers an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research with transformational impact to clinical and research medicine across a wide array of diseases, working with decades of high-quality imaging data alongside clinical domain experts at a nationally recognized top-10 medical center. The position also provides opportunities to publish, present at research conferences, and for professional advancement. Salary and benefits are set according to experience and to UCSF salary scales.

Inquiries should be emailed directly to Dr. Arnaout and should include a CV and a letter of interest clearly but briefly articulating why you are interested in joining the lab. Graduate and postdoctoral candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

Requirements:<br>
•	strong interpersonal and communication skills<br>
•	working with patient data in a HIPPA-compliant and morally and ethically responsible manner<br>
•	working closely with an expert interdisciplinary team including both medical and data science professionals<br>
•	working independently to complete assigned responsibilities<br>
•	strong organizational, record-keeping, and written and oral communication skills<br>
•	strong motivation to apply pioneering breakthroughs to the practical, personalized everyday care of patients<br>
•	A Master’s, PhD, or equivalent experience in computer science or related field.<br>
•	Fluency with Python, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow/Theano/Pytorch, and related programming languages, as well as data visualizations (ideally using d3.js, R, Matlab, pylab, seaborn, etc). Specific experience with computer vision projects, and with AWS/cloud computing is a plus.<br>
<br>

The successful candidate will be skilled at: <br>
•	applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning and other computational techniques (including but not limited to neural networks (including CNNs, autoencoders, de-noisers, GANs), discriminant analysis, tree-based methods, boosting, random forests, and support vector machines, as well as [incremental] principal/independent component analysis, t-SNE, and data augmentation techniques) to imaging data<br>
•	‘cleaning’ data of several types (e.g. semi-structured text, images, vectors/matrices)<br>
•	organizing and deploying code and data-labeling tasks across members of the research team (through either home-grown or off-the-shelf solutions)<br>
•	producing data visualizations and analyses for machine learning results<br><br>
