<!-- Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. -->

We are hiring a data scientist with early-to-mid career skills and experience. The position offers an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research with transformational impact to clinical and research medicine across a wide array of diseases, working with decades of high-quality imaging data alongside clinical domain experts. It also provides opportunities to publish, present at research conferences, and for professional advancement. Salary and benefits are set according to experience and to UCSF salary scales.

Requirements:<br>
•	strong interpersonal and communication skills<br>
•	working with patient data in a HIPPA-compliant and morally and ethically responsible manner<br>
•	working closely with an expert interdisciplinary team including both medical and data science professionals<br>
•	working independently to complete assigned responsibilities<br>
•	strong organizational, record-keeping, and written and oral communication skills<br>
•	strong motivation to apply pioneering breakthroughs to the practical, personalized everyday care of patients<br>
•	A Master’s, PhD, or similar degree in computer science or related field. Would consider a candidate with an alternate background with demonstrated experience in computer science and biomedical research (e.g., MD with dedicated clinical informatics or data engineering fellowship training; BS with demonstrated postgraduate experience in data engineering).<br>
•	Fluency with Python, SQL, distributed/cloud computing (e.g. AWS, GCP), shell scripting. Proficiency in applying supervised machine learning techniques (eg neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines) to medical data is a plus.<br>

The successful candidate will:<br>
•	be proficient in mining and ‘cleaning’ data of several types (e.g. semi-structured text, images, vectors/matrices)<br>
•	be proficient in organizing and deploying code and data-labeling tasks across members of the research team (through either home-grown or off-the-shelf solutions)<br>
<br>
•	be proficient in applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning and other computational techniques (including but not limited to neural networks, discriminant analysis, tree-based methods, boosting, random forests, and support vector machines, as well as [incremental] principal/independent component analysis, t-SNE, and data augmentation techniques) to imaging data<br>
•	be proficient in producing excellent data visualizations and analyses for machine learning results<br><br>
<br>

Inquiries should be emailed directly to Dr. Arnaout and should include a CV and a letter of interest clearly but briefly articulating why you are interested in joining the lab. Graduate and postdoctoral candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.
